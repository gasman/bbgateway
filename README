Setting up a bbgateway installation
-----------------------------------
* Create a mysql database (or use some other database engine - although
that's untested...) with the schema given in newsgroups-extended.sql
* Edit database.rb to point to that database
* Run the NNTP server, nntp.rb; use nntp.rb -? for options. To run on a port
number under 1024 (including the default port, 119) you'll need to be root.
As this needs to run continuously, it probably makes sense to run this in a
'screen' session.
* At this point, you should be able to connect to your news server through
your favourite news reading client, but it'll be rather empty.
* Run fetch.rb periodically. This will fetch any new articles posted in the
last day to the www.worldofspectrum.org forums and add them to the news feed.
* Rewrite fetch.rb as appropriate for your desired web forum. Yes, that's
right, I'm hoping people won't just run thousands of scrapers for World Of
Spectrum here... Generic VBulletin forum support is coming Real Soon Now -
support for other forums such as PHPBB will probably come Vaguely Soon Now.
