Operations we need to perform on the groups collection:

(for RFC977)
* LIST: listing them all, with first_id and last_id
* NEWGROUPS: listing all groups created since 'date' (optionally filtered by name prefix)
* GROUP: returning first_id, last_id and (estimated) count for an individual group
* LAST/NEXT: need to traverse the list of articles. Probably want to keep an index as well as a pointer to current article, then.
* NEWNEWS: listing message IDs of articles created since 'date', filtered by stupid overengineered wildcard scheme on name

* ARTICLE/BODY/HEAD/STAT: fetching by either in-group ID or message-id
and returning body / headers including the required ones...
required headers are:
	Relay-Version, - obsolete
	Posting-Version, - obsolete
	From, - get Article model to provide this
	Date, - get Article model to provide this as a Time, BUT also need to search on this
	Newsgroups, - need to consider cross-posts
	Subject, - get Article model to provide this
	Message-ID, - used in protocol
	Path - fake this, end it with !not-for-mail

ignore for now:
* IHAVE
* POST
